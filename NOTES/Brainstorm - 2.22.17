Boot up sequence is something like:
    mate-app -> mate-core
    mate-core -> mate-config
    mate-core -> mate-auth
    mate-core reads enabled-modules
    mate-core boots each modules

Mate Core has 4 ports running, each which have a subdomain pointed at them via nginx.
    -public - This is standard domain, and contains the public websites of the alliance.
    -secure - Members and allies only.
    -admin - Admins only.
    -API - API that ties everything together.

Accessing secure and admin require a valid auth token, but the token doesn't expire.
A cold visit to the site with a token should force the token to expire.
The API has 4 levels of access:
    * public - No valid token required. (Killboards, blogs)
    * private - Valid token required, but does not expire on use.
    * secure - Valid token required, expires on use.
    * admin - Valid token required, expires on use. 

Each module supplies mate-core with a list of endpoints and files, as well as details about each. Mate then sets up the server.

Modules should be of the structure:
    index.js        //Should minimally supply all functionality of the API.
    config.js
    client          //Client interface files.
        src
        style
        html
        misc
        assets.js
    admin           //Admin interface files.
        src
        style
        html
        misc
        assets.js
    api
        routes.js
                    //File structure mimicing endpoints. One endpoint per file.
                    //Endpoints must match the mate-module endpoint definition.
                    //API should do mimimal work here, rather just check arguments.
    server
                    //File structure can be however.
                    //Most of work from API and elsewhere should be done here.
    maint
        sql - Each module has a seperate scheme.
            versions
            patches
        scripts
            -For anything fancy
